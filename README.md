# Extending Extension Fingerprinting to Mobile Devices

This artifact contains the files relevant to our WPES 2023 Paper "Extending Browser Extension Fingerprinting to Mobile Devices." Please find the PDF [here](https://briankim113.github.io/files/wpes23.pdf).

``public`` folder contains the HTML page with referenced JavaScript attack files that a client will access.

JavaScript files in the root directory set up the server, connecting the page and the database.

Please contact Brian Hyeongseok Kim at brian.hs.kim@usc.edu for any questions.

## Instructions
Type ``npm start`` at the root directory to start the application, as defined in ``app.js``.

The code assumes that the page is accessible at port 3000 and the MongoDB database is accessible at port 27017.
